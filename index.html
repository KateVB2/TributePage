          <div id="img-caption" class="img-caption">Jane Austen was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique, and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Her work often explored the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Austen published her work anonymously under the pen name <i>a Lady</i> and enjoyed only modest success in her lifetime. Since the mid-nineteenth century however, her six major novels have rarely been out of print.</div>

        <p>Austen's novels are beloved for the adventures and misfortunes of their memorable heroines. As such, they have been widely adapted for theatre and film, with <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (1995) and <i>Clueless</i> (1995), amongst many others, receiving awards.</p>

        <h3>Austen, an early feminist?</h3>
        <p>Jane Austen’s novels are not feminist in the way we mean it today. But they do hint at the need for equality between the sexes. Her heroines defy gender norms, and push for more agency in their own lives. The overarching theme that runs throughout all her novels is the inequality faced by women in Regency society.</p>
